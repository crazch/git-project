              A fully responsive website built with HTML5 and modern CSS, designed to simulate a real-world canteen layout. The project features a clean design, intuitive structure, and semantic elements to ensure accessibility and maintainability. It adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using media queries. .Through this guided project, I developed a stronger grasp of layout fundamentals, responsive design techniques, and semantic HTML structure. It solidified my understanding of how to build professional-looking static websites from scratch.

            <p class="project-description">
              A dynamic full stack web application designed to create, manage, and organize personal notes with the help of AI suggestions. The app features a user-friendly interface, secure back-end handling, and smart logic that connects HTML forms, PHP scripts, and database functionality. Ideal for users who want to keep their thoughts organized while benefiting from automated content suggestions. This project deepened my understanding of how front-end and back-end components communicate through form data and server requests. I also learned how to structure a full stack application from scratch ‚Äî managing files, linking pages, and building a working data flow.

              <span class="project-date">(June 2025)</span>
            </div>
            <p class="project-description">
              A front-end prototype of a cashier interface built to simulate the input and display of item data such as product name, price, stock availability, and barcode. Designed with a minimalist layout and clear input fields, this project focuses on usability and prepares for future integration with real-time databases or point-of-sale systems. This project helped me understand how real-world forms are structured and styled. I focused on building a user-centered layout while keeping the design extensible for future enhancements like database connections or JavaScript-powered validation.
